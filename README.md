Shitstorm is a _simple_, _fast_ and _opinionated_ ticket tracking system.

It tries not to include all the *bloat* that I usually found in most BTS
software.

_* Features *_

* Simple states: active or resolved. They can be toggled, and you can use
  comments (see below) for details
* A powerful search system
* Easy user management (create/delete, one admin)
* Simple text formatting (based on [Calico](http://github.com/madx))
